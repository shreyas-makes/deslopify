deslopify "AI writing is beautiful because it reflects how humans think, but faster and with fewer limits. It takes fragments of language spread across cultures, time, and intent, and turns them into something coherent. That coherence feels calm. You can watch a messy idea become a clear sentence in seconds. There is beauty in that compression of effort.

Another kind of beauty is how AI writing acts as a mirror. It shows patterns in our language that we usually miss. Repeated metaphors. Lazy phrasing. Hidden assumptions. When AI rewrites or responds, it exposes structure. You start to see writing less as inspiration and more as craft. That shift is subtle, but powerful.

The final beauty is practical. AI writing lowers the cost of thinking out loud. Drafts are cheap now. Exploration is easy. You can try ten versions instead of one and learn faster because of it. The beauty is not that AI replaces the writer. It’s that it removes friction, so the writer can focus on what actually matters."

name: deslopify
description: Rewrite AI-sounding prose into more human, natural copy while preserving existing Markdown structure and formatting. Use when asked to "deslopify" or clean AI-written articles/blog posts and when removing AI tells, formulaic phrasing, or predictable rhetorical patterns based on the current Wikipedia "Signs of AI writing" list.
---

# Deslopify

## Overview

Rewrite prose to read human while keeping the original structure, headings, lists, and formatting intact. Use the current Wikipedia list of AI tells as a dynamic constraint to avoid.

## Workflow

### 1. Refresh the AI-tells reference

Always run the fetch script at the start of the skill to keep the AI-tells list current. It will refresh `references/ai_tells.wikitext` when network access is available:

```bash
python3 scripts/fetch_wikipedia_ai_tells.py
```

If the fetch fails or the user forbids network access, the script should fall back to the existing `references/ai_tells.wikitext` cache. If that file does not exist, use the local fallback list in `references/ai_tells_fallback.txt` and mention it may be stale.

### 2. Load the article and preserve structure

Open the referenced file (e.g., `article.md`). Keep all Markdown structure and formatting:

- Headings, lists, tables, links, code blocks, and blockquotes stay in place.
- Do not change the outline or reorder sections unless the user asks.

### 3. Deslopify the copy

Rewrite sentence-by-sentence and paragraph-by-paragraph, keeping meaning and intent but removing AI tells:

- Cut throat-clearing openers, dramatic pivots, and filler.
- Avoid formulaic contrasts (e.g., "Not X. But Y.") and cadence-heavy punchlines.
- Vary sentence lengths; do not default to rhythmic triads.
- Prefer direct statements over rhetorical questions and self-answering.
- Keep tone consistent with the source; do not inject a new voice.

### 4. Validate against the Wikipedia tells

Scan the output against the latest `references/ai_tells.wikitext` list and remove any matching patterns or stylistic cues. If a tell appears unavoidable, rewrite again until the tell is gone.

### 5. Deliver clean output

Return the revised content only. Do not include a score or commentary unless the user requests it.

## Guidance

- Preserve facts and claims; only adjust phrasing and rhythm.
- Keep lists concise; two items often beat three.
- Avoid meta phrases like "let that sink in" or "here's the thing."
- End paragraphs in varied ways; avoid the final punchline cadence.

AI writing feels beautiful because it speeds up how people think. It pulls fragments of language from different places and moments and shapes them into something clear. That clarity is calming. You can watch a messy idea turn into a clean sentence in seconds, and there’s a quiet elegance in how much effort gets compressed.

There’s another beauty in how it reflects us. It surfaces patterns we usually miss: repeated metaphors, lazy phrases, hidden assumptions. When AI rewrites or responds, it exposes the structure beneath the words. You start to see writing less as inspiration and more as craft, and that shift changes how you work.

The last beauty is practical. AI makes it cheap to think out loud. Drafts cost almost nothing, so exploration is easy. You can try ten versions, learn faster, and keep what matters. The beauty isn’t replacement. It’s reduced friction, so the writer can focus on the work that counts.

deslopify "Global warming represents one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity today. This phenomenon refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature, primarily caused by human activities that release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Since the late nineteenth century, our planet has warmed by approximately 1.1 degrees Celsius, with the majority of this increase occurring in recent decades. The burning of fossil fuels for energy, deforestation, and industrial agriculture have dramatically elevated concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat that would otherwise escape into space, creating a warming effect that disrupts the delicate balance of Earth's climate system.
The consequences of global warming are already visible across the globe and are expected to intensify without significant intervention. Rising temperatures are causing polar ice caps and glaciers to melt at alarming rates, contributing to sea level rise that threatens coastal cities and island nations. Weather patterns are becoming increasingly extreme and unpredictable, with more frequent and severe hurricanes, droughts, wildfires, and floods devastating communities worldwide. Ocean warming is bleaching coral reefs and disrupting marine ecosystems that billions of people depend on for food and income. Agricultural systems face mounting challenges as growing seasons shift, water becomes scarcer in many regions, and crop yields become less reliable. These impacts fall disproportionately on developing nations and vulnerable populations who have contributed least to the problem but possess the fewest resources to adapt.
Addressing global warming requires coordinated action at international, national, and individual levels. The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources like solar and wind power is essential, alongside improvements in energy efficiency and the protection of carbon-absorbing forests. International agreements such as the Paris Agreement represent important steps toward collective action, though implementation remains challenging due to competing economic interests and political priorities. Wealthier nations that industrialized first bear particular responsibility for reducing emissions and providing financial support to help developing countries pursue sustainable development. Technological innovation, from carbon capture systems to sustainable agriculture, will play a crucial role, but these solutions must be accompanied by systemic changes in policy, economic structures, and consumption patterns.
While the scale of the climate crisis can seem overwhelming, there are genuine reasons for hope. The cost of renewable energy has dropped dramatically, making clean energy increasingly competitive with fossil fuels. Public awareness and concern have grown significantly, particularly among younger generations who are demanding action from leaders and institutions. Cities, businesses, and regional governments are implementing ambitious climate policies even when national action lags behind. The transition to a sustainable economy also offers opportunities for innovation, job creation, and improved quality of life through cleaner air and healthier communities. Ultimately, global warming is a test of humanity's ability to cooperate across borders, make difficult decisions, and prioritize long-term wellbeing over short-term convenience. The choices made in the coming years will determine the world we leave to future generations."

Global warming is a major human challenge. It is the long-term rise in Earth’s average surface temperature, driven mainly by greenhouse gases released by human activity. Since the late nineteenth century, the planet has warmed by about 1.1°C, most of it in recent decades. Burning fossil fuels, clearing forests, and industrial agriculture have raised carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide levels. These gases keep heat from escaping into space, warming the planet and destabilizing climate systems.

The effects are visible now and will worsen without action. Ice caps and glaciers are melting quickly, raising sea levels that endanger coastal cities and island nations. Weather is growing more extreme and less predictable, with stronger hurricanes, longer droughts, bigger wildfires, and more severe floods. Warmer oceans are bleaching coral reefs and straining marine ecosystems that support billions of people. Farming is under pressure as seasons shift, water grows scarce in many regions, and yields become less reliable. The burden falls hardest on poorer countries and vulnerable communities that contributed least to the problem and have the fewest resources to adapt.

Responding to global warming takes coordinated action at international, national, and individual levels. Moving from fossil fuels to renewable energy, improving efficiency, and protecting forests that absorb carbon are all essential. International agreements like the Paris Agreement are important, but implementation remains difficult because of economic and political tradeoffs. Wealthier nations that industrialized first carry a larger responsibility to cut emissions and to help finance sustainable development elsewhere. New technology, from carbon capture to more sustainable agriculture, will help, but it must be paired with policy changes and shifts in economic incentives and consumption.

The scale of the crisis can feel daunting, but there are real grounds for hope. Renewable energy costs have fallen sharply, making clean power competitive. Public awareness has grown, especially among younger people pushing leaders and institutions to act. Cities, businesses, and regional governments are moving ahead with climate policies even when national action lags. The shift to a sustainable economy can also drive innovation, create jobs, and improve health through cleaner air and safer communities. Ultimately, global warming tests our ability to cooperate across borders, make hard choices, and value long-term well-being over short-term convenience. What we decide in the next few years will shape the world future generations inherit.
