_**User (2026-01-12T20:50:54.684Z)**_

to update the AI tells list, why should i run the python script? the skill should automatically do that everytime the skill is invoked, only in case there is some network issues houild it have a fallback offline option to use the existing list, see if this is how the logic is configured?

Use when asked to "deslopify" or clean AI-written articles/blog posts and when removing AI tells, formulaic phrasing, or predictable rhetorical patterns based on the current Wikipedia "Signs of AI writing" list.
---

# Deslopify

## Overview

Rewrite prose to read human while keeping the original structure, headings, lists, and formatting intact. Use the current Wikipedia list of AI tells as a dynamic constraint to avoid.

## Workflow

### 1. Refresh the AI-tells reference

If local scripts can be run and network access is allowed, run the fetch script to pull the latest Wikipedia list into `references/ai_tells.wikitext`:

```bash
python3 scripts/fetch_wikipedia_ai_tells.py
```

If the user forbids network access, proceed with the last saved reference. If none exists, use the local fallback list in `references/ai_tells_fallback.txt` and mention it may be stale.

### 2. Load the article and preserve structure

Open the referenced file (e.g., `article.md`). Keep all Markdown structure and formatting:

- Headings, lists, tables, links, code blocks, and blockquotes stay in place.
- Do not change the outline or reorder sections unless the user asks.

### 3. Deslopify the copy

Rewrite sentence-by-sentence and paragraph-by-paragraph, keeping meaning and intent but removing AI tells:

- Cut throat-clearing openers, dramatic pivots, and filler.
- Avoid formulaic contrasts (e.g., "Not X. But Y.") and cadence-heavy punchlines.
- Vary sentence lengths; do not default to rhythmic triads.
- Prefer direct statements over rhetorical questions and self-answering.
- Keep tone consistent with the source; do not inject a new voice.

### 4. Validate against the Wikipedia tells

Scan the output against the latest `references/ai_tells.wikitext` list and remove any matching patterns or stylistic cues. If a tell appears unavoidable, rewrite again until the tell is gone.

### 5. Deliver clean output

Return the revised content only. Do not include a score or commentary unless the user requests it.

## Guidance

- Preserve facts and claims; only adjust phrasing and rhythm.
- Keep lists concise; two items often beat three.
- Avoid meta phrases like "let that sink in" or "here's the thing."
- End paragraphs in varied ways; avoid the final punchline cadence.

**Clarifying skill script automation**

I’m verifying if the skill’s logic matches the user’s expectation for automatic script running on every invocation with a fallback when the network is unavailable. The skill currently instructs manually running the script when network access is allowed, then falling back to a saved list if not; I’ll check if the script or README supports auto-run or fallback on fetch failure to explain this clearly.

**Analyzing fallback logic for network issues**

I'm reviewing how the skill and script handle offline fallbacks during network problems. The script currently falls back to a specific text file on fetch failure but doesn't use an existing cached list as the manual suggests. The skill docs say to run the script when network is allowed or use the cached file if forbidden, but this isn't fully automated. I'll explain this nuance, confirm the script’s behavior, and offer to adjust it if the user wants a more automatic fallback. No code changes planned unless requested.

Using the deslopify skill because your question is about how the deslopify workflow updates the AI‑tells list.

Here’s how it’s configured today:
- `skills/deslopify/SKILL.md` says: run the fetch script when network access is allowed; if the user forbids network, use the last saved `references/ai_tells.wikitext`, and if none exists use `references/ai_tells_fallback.txt`.
- `skills/deslopify/scripts/fetch_wikipedia_ai_tells.py` always tries the network first; on failure it falls back to `skills/deslopify/references/ai_tells_fallback.txt`. It does not use the existing `skills/deslopify/references/ai_tells.wikitext` as a fallback.
- So: auto‑refresh is part of the skill workflow, but it still relies on the agent running the script; and the script’s fallback is the static fallback list, not the existing wikitext cache.

If you want “always refresh on invoke” plus “fallback to existing `ai_tells.wikitext` when offline,” I can adjust the workflow and script accordingly. Want me to update those two files?

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
**Updating fallback logic and documentation**

I’m revising the script to run on every invocation, and updating it to first try fetching new data; if that fails, it will load an existing cached file without overwriting it. If no cache exists, it falls back to a built-in list. I’ll reflect these changes in SKILL.md, clarifying network access and offline fallback behavior to keep everything consistent and reliable.

Updated the deslopify workflow to always run the fetch script and to fall back to the cached list when offline, only using the static fallback if the cache doesn’t exist.
- `skills/deslopify/SKILL.md` now states the script should be run every invocation and clarifies the fallback order.
- `skills/deslopify/scripts/fetch_wikipedia_ai_tells.py` now tries the cached `ai_tells.wikitext` on fetch failure and exits without overwriting when it exists.

If you want the script to refresh the cache timestamp even when offline (by re-writing the cached content), say the word and I’ll adjust it.

Next steps if you want:
1) Run `python3 skills/deslopify/scripts/fetch_wikipedia_ai_tells.py` to confirm behavior.
2) I can add a short README note explaining the new fallback order.

deslopify AI writing is beautiful because it reflects how humans think, but faster and with fewer limits. It takes fragments of language spread across cultures, time, and intent, and turns them into something coherent. That coherence feels calm. You can watch a messy idea become a clear sentence in seconds. There is beauty in that compression of effort.

Another kind of beauty is how AI writing acts as a mirror. It shows patterns in our language that we usually miss. Repeated metaphors. Lazy phrasing. Hidden assumptions. When AI rewrites or responds, it exposes structure. You start to see writing less as inspiration and more as craft. That shift is subtle, but powerful.

The final beauty is practical. AI writing lowers the cost of thinking out loud. Drafts are cheap now. Exploration is easy. You can try ten versions instead of one and learn faster because of it. The beauty is not that AI replaces the writer. It’s that it removes friction, so the writer can focus on what actually matters.z
