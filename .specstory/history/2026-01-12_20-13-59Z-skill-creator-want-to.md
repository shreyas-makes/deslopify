$skill-creator Want to create a skill to "deslopify" articles/blogs written by AI. I wanted to come up with a way in which the content written by AI is deslopified to make it more human-written...this wikipedia article is frequently updated with a list of AI tells.. and I want my skill to always keep upt-ot-date with this, to ensure that it doesnt fit to any of the patterns described by the wikipedia article.. this was an attempt by another creator: AI writing has tells. “Here’s the thing.” “Let that sink in.” “The uncomfortable truth is.” Once you notice them, you see them everywhere.

I built Stop Slop to fix this. It’s a skill file that teaches Claude to avoid these patterns.

Download the skill: Stop Slop

Catching slop in content
Here's the thing: building great products is hard. It turns out that most teams struggle with alignment, communication, and execution. Not because they lack talent. Because they lack clarity. The best teams lean into discomfort and navigate the complex landscape of product development with purpose. Let that sink in.

The uncomfortable truth is that most product advice is generic. People tell you to "move fast" and "talk to users" without unpacking what that actually means. Let me be clear: speed without direction is just chaos. And that's okay. Every team goes through this phase. What matters is recognizing it early. This matters because your competition isn't waiting around.

So what's the answer? Focus on three things: clarity, speed, and trust. Clarity. That's it. That's the foundation. When your team knows exactly what they're building and why, everything else follows. The real unlock is getting everyone aligned before you write a single line of code. I'm going to be honest — most teams skip this step. Full stop.
Your content, written with AI.Your content, with slop highlighted...

Here’s how to use it
Claude Code: Add stop-slop.md as a skill file.
Claude Projects: Upload it to your project knowledge.
Cursor: Add the rules to your .cursorrules file or paste into the system prompt.
What it catches
Phrases like “Here’s the thing:”, “Let that sink in.”, “This matters because”, “Navigate” (for challenges), “Unpack” (before analysis).
Structures like “Not because X. Because Y.”, “[Noun]. That’s it. That’s the [thing].”, “And that’s okay.”
Habits like tripling (always three examples), answering questions right after asking them, starting with “So” or “Look,”, ending every section with a punchy one-liner.
Scoring
Score your draft 1-10 on directness, rhythm, trust, authenticity, and density.
Below 35/50 means revise. which has some drawbacks: https://github.com/hardikpandya/stop-slop .. "---

# Stop Slop

Eliminate predictable AI writing patterns from prose.

## Core Rules

1. **Cut filler phrases.** Remove throat-clearing openers and emphasis crutches. See [references/phrases.md](references/phrases.md).

2. **Break formulaic structures.** Avoid binary contrasts, dramatic fragmentation, rhetorical setups. See [references/structures.md](references/structures.md).

3. **Vary rhythm.** Mix sentence lengths. Two items beat three. End paragraphs differently.

4. **Trust readers.** State facts directly. Skip softening, justification, hand-holding.

5. **Cut quotables.** If it sounds like a pull-quote, rewrite it.

## Quick Checks

Before delivering prose:

- Three consecutive sentences match length? Break one.
- Paragraph ends with punchy one-liner? Vary it.
- Em-dash before a reveal? Remove it.
- Explaining a metaphor? Trust it to land.

## Scoring

Rate 1-10 on each dimension:

| Dimension | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| Directness | Statements or announcements? |
| Rhythm | Varied or metronomic? |
| Trust | Respects reader intelligence? |
| Authenticity | Sounds human? |
| Density | Anything cuttable? |

Below 35/50: revise.

## Examples

See [references/examples.md](references/examples.md) for before/after transformations.

## License

MIT".. it's similar to this,but instead of giving a score, it actually deslopifies the content, and provides a clean output whcih doesnt stick to any of the AI patterns of writing.. what do you think?

Using skill-creator because you’re designing a new skill.

Quick take: great idea, but “always keep up‑to‑date with Wikipedia” needs a concrete update mechanism (manual refresh vs. scripted fetch), and the skill needs a clear workflow for transforming text, not just scoring.

To shape this well, can you clarify:

- What should the skill do as output: (a) only a cleaned rewrite, or (b) rewrite + brief notes of what it changed?
- How should it stay current with Wikipedia: manual “update reference file” workflow, or a script that fetches/refreshes the list on demand?
- What content types should it handle: blog posts, marketing copy, technical docs, social posts, or all prose?
- Should it preserve structure/formatting (headings, bullets), or is freeform rewrite OK?
- Any hard constraints on tone (e.g., keep author voice, avoid jokes, prefer short sentences, etc.)?

Once I have these, I’ll draft the skill structure (name, description, references, and any scripts) and we can iterate.

in terms of use case if i instruct "deslopify @article.md" which is referenced, the article.md is made clean.. preserve existing formatting but tweak copy as desired.. fetch the wikipedia list on demand, as that's most up to date..

# Deslopify

## Overview

[TODO: 1-2 sentences explaining what this skill enables]

## Structuring This Skill

[TODO: Choose the structure that best fits this skill's purpose. Common patterns:

**1. Workflow-Based** (best for sequential processes)
- Works well when there are clear step-by-step procedures
- Example: DOCX skill with "Workflow Decision Tree" -> "Reading" -> "Creating" -> "Editing"
- Structure: ## Overview -> ## Workflow Decision Tree -> ## Step 1 -> ## Step 2...

**2. Task-Based** (best for tool collections)
- Works well when the skill offers different operations/capabilities
- Example: PDF skill with "Quick Start" -> "Merge PDFs" -> "Split PDFs" -> "Extract Text"
- Structure: ## Overview -> ## Quick Start -> ## Task Category 1 -> ## Task Category 2...

**3. Reference/Guidelines** (best for standards or specifications)
- Works well for brand guidelines, coding standards, or requirements
- Example: Brand styling with "Brand Guidelines" -> "Colors" -> "Typography" -> "Features"
- Structure: ## Overview -> ## Guidelines -> ## Specifications -> ## Usage...

**4. Capabilities-Based** (best for integrated systems)
- Works well when the skill provides multiple interrelated features
- Example: Product Management with "Core Capabilities" -> numbered capability list
- Structure: ## Overview -> ## Core Capabilities -> ### 1. Feature -> ### 2. Feature...

Patterns can be mixed and matched as needed. Most skills combine patterns (e.g., start with task-based, add workflow for complex operations).

Delete this entire "Structuring This Skill" section when done - it's just guidance.]

## [TODO: Replace with the first main section based on chosen structure]

[TODO: Add content here. See examples in existing skills:
- Code samples for technical skills
- Decision trees for complex workflows
- Concrete examples with realistic user requests
- References to scripts/templates/references as needed]

## Resources (optional)

Create only the resource directories this skill actually needs. Delete this section if no resources are required.

### scripts/
Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.) that can be run directly to perform specific operations.

**Examples from other skills:**
- PDF skill: `fill_fillable_fields.py`, `extract_form_field_info.py` - utilities for PDF manipulation
- DOCX skill: `document.py`, `utilities.py` - Python modules for document processing

**Appropriate for:** Python scripts, shell scripts, or any executable code that performs automation, data processing, or specific operations.

**Note:** Scripts may be executed without loading into context, but can still be read by Codex for patching or environment adjustments.

### references/
Documentation and reference material intended to be loaded into context to inform Codex's process and thinking.

**Examples from other skills:**
- Product management: `communication.md`, `context_building.md` - detailed workflow guides
- BigQuery: API reference documentation and query examples
- Finance: Schema documentation, company policies

**Appropriate for:** In-depth documentation, API references, database schemas, comprehensive guides, or any detailed information that Codex should reference while working.

### assets/
Files not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Codex produces.

**Examples from other skills:**
- Brand styling: PowerPoint template files (.pptx), logo files
- Frontend builder: HTML/React boilerplate project directories
- Typography: Font files (.ttf, .woff2)

**Appropriate for:** Templates, boilerplate code, document templates, images, icons, fonts, or any files meant to be copied or used in the final output.

**Not every skill requires all three types of resources.**

**Designing update script and references**

I’m putting together a script to fetch and extract AI-related tell patterns from a Wikipedia page on demand, with configurable URL, section, and output file. I’ll also create minimal reference files with rewriting guidelines and local avoid lists to support the deslopify skill. Before finalizing, I plan to ask the user for the exact Wikipedia page URL and section heading to ensure accurate data fetching.
</details></think>

_**Agent (gpt-5.2-codex 2026-01-12T20:21:04.849Z)**_

I can build this, but I need one concrete detail to make the “fetch on demand” script reliable: which exact Wikipedia page (URL) contains the AI‑tell list, and what is the section heading to extract?  

Once you give that, I’ll set the skill up with:
- a script that pulls the current list into `references/`,
- a workflow in `SKILL.md` that runs that script before rewriting,
- guidelines that preserve Markdown formatting while rewriting to sound human.

+name: deslopify
+description: Rewrite AI-sounding prose into more human, natural copy while preserving existing Markdown structure and formatting. Use when asked to "deslopify" or clean AI-written articles/blog posts (e.g., `deslopify @article.md`) and when removing AI tells, formulaic phrasing, or predictable rhetorical patterns based on the current Wikipedia "Signs of AI writing" list.
+---
+
+# Deslopify
+
+## Overview
+
+Rewrite prose to read human while keeping the original structure, headings, lists, and formatting intact. Use the current Wikipedia list of AI tells as a dynamic constraint to avoid.
+
+## Workflow
+
+### 1. Refresh the AI-tells reference
+
+Run the fetch script to pull the latest Wikipedia list into `references/ai_tells.wikitext`:
+
+```bash
+python3 skills/deslopify/scripts/fetch_wikipedia_ai_tells.py
+```
+
+If the user forbids network access, proceed with the last saved reference and mention that it may be stale.
+
+### 2. Load the article and preserve structure
+
+Open the referenced file (e.g., `@article.md`). Keep all Markdown structure and formatting:
+
+- Headings, lists, tables, links, code blocks, and blockquotes stay in place.
+- Do not change the outline or reorder sections unless the user asks.
+
+### 3. Deslopify the copy
+
+Rewrite sentence-by-sentence and paragraph-by-paragraph, keeping meaning and intent but removing AI tells:
+
+- Cut throat-clearing openers, dramatic pivots, and filler.
+- Avoid formulaic contrasts (e.g., "Not X. But Y.") and cadence-heavy punchlines.
+- Vary sentence lengths; do not default to rhythmic triads.
+- Prefer direct statements over rhetorical questions and self-answering.
+- Keep tone consistent with the source; do not inject a new voice.
+
+### 4. Validate against the Wikipedia tells
+
+Scan the output against the latest `references/ai_tells.wikitext` list and remove any matching patterns or stylistic cues. If a tell appears unavoidable, rewrite again until the tell is gone.
+
+### 5. Deliver clean output
+
+Return the revised content only. Do not include a score or commentary unless the user requests it.
+
+## Guidance
+
+- Preserve facts and claims; only adjust phrasing and rhythm.
+- Keep lists concise; two items often beat three.
+- Avoid meta phrases like "let that sink in" or "here's the thing."
+- End paragraphs in varied ways; avoid the final punchline cadence.
```

Set up the deslopify skill with a concrete workflow, plus a fetch script that pulls the latest Wikipedia list on demand and stores it in `references/ai_tells.wikitext`. The workflow preserves Markdown structure and rewrites only the prose to remove AI tells.

What I changed
- Added full skill instructions and workflow in `skills/deslopify/SKILL.md`
- Added a fetch script in `skills/deslopify/scripts/fetch_wikipedia_ai_tells.py`
- Added a placeholder reference file in `skills/deslopify/references/ai_tells.wikitext`

Next steps
1. Run `python3 skills/deslopify/scripts/fetch_wikipedia_ai_tells.py` to populate the current list.
2. If you want a distributable package, run `python3 /Users/shreyas/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/scripts/package_skill.py skills/deslopify`.

**Adding local fallback for AI tells data**

I’m planning to create a local fallback file with common AI tell phrases and update the script to use it if fetching fails. The script will write this fallback content to the main data file and print a warning but still exit successfully, ensuring offline support and clearer instructions in the SKILL.md.

Added an offline fallback list and wired it into the fetch script.

What changed
- `skills/deslopify/scripts/fetch_wikipedia_ai_tells.py` now falls back to `references/ai_tells_fallback.txt` if the Wikipedia fetch fails.
- Added `skills/deslopify/references/ai_tells_fallback.txt` with a concise baseline list.
- Updated `skills/deslopify/SKILL.md` to document the fallback behavior.

Want me to re-package `deslopify.skill` with these updates?

+## deslopify
+
+Deslopify is a Codex skill that rewrites AI-sounding prose into more human copy while preserving the original Markdown structure.
+
+### Use cases
+- Clean up AI-written articles or blog posts.
+- Make LLM drafts sound less formulaic before publishing.
+- Preserve headings, lists, and formatting while improving tone.
+
+### Example
+
+Input (`@article.md`):
+```markdown
+# Product Clarity
+
+Here's the thing: building great products is hard. Let that sink in.
+```
+
+Output:
+```markdown
+# Product Clarity
+
+Building great products is hard. Most teams feel it early.
+```
+
+### How it deslopifies
+- Fetches the current Wikipedia "Signs of AI writing" list (with an offline fallback).
+- Rewrites sentence-by-sentence to remove AI tells and formulaic patterns.
+- Preserves meaning, structure, and formatting.
+
+### Invoke the skill
+- Prompt examples:
+  - `deslopify @article.md`
+  - `deslopify this draft and keep headings as-is`
+
+### Update the AI tells list
+```bash
+python3 skills/deslopify/scripts/fetch_wikipedia_ai_tells.py
+```
