# Skill Creator

This skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.

## About Skills

Skills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Codex's capabilities by providing
specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as "onboarding guides" for specific
domains or tasks—they transform Codex from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent
equipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.

### What Skills Provide

1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains
2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs
3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic
4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks

## Core Principles

### Concise is Key

The context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Codex needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.

**Default assumption: Codex is already very smart.** Only add context Codex doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: "Does Codex really need this explanation?" and "Does this paragraph justify its token cost?"

Prefer concise examples over verbose explanations.

### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom

Match the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:

**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.

**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.

**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.

Think of Codex as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).

### Anatomy of a Skill

Every skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)
│   │   ├── name: (required)
│   │   └── description: (required)
│   └── Markdown instructions (required)
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)
    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed
    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)
```

#### SKILL.md (required)

Every SKILL.md consists of:

- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Codex reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.
- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).

#### Bundled Resources (optional)

##### Scripts (`scripts/`)

Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.

- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed
- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks
- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context
- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Codex for patching or environment-specific adjustments

##### References (`references/`)

Documentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Codex's process and thinking.

- **When to include**: For documentation that Codex should reference while working
- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications
- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides
- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Codex determines it's needed
- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md
- **Avoid duplication**: Information shoul

name: deslopify
description: Rewrite AI-sounding prose into more human, natural copy while preserving existing Markdown structure and formatting. Use when asked to "deslopify" or clean AI-written articles/blog posts (e.g., `deslopify @article.md`) and when removing AI tells, formulaic phrasing, or predictable rhetorical patterns based on the current Wikipedia "Signs of AI writing" list.
---

# Deslopify

## Overview

Rewrite prose to read human while keeping the original structure, headings, lists, and formatting intact. Use the current Wikipedia list of AI tells as a dynamic constraint to avoid.

## Workflow

### 1. Refresh the AI-tells reference

Run the fetch script to pull the latest Wikipedia list into `references/ai_tells.wikitext`:

```bash
python3 skills/deslopify/scripts/fetch_wikipedia_ai_tells.py
```

If the user forbids network access, proceed with the last saved reference. If none exists, use the local fallback list in `references/ai_tells_fallback.txt` and mention it may be stale.

### 2. Load the article and preserve structure

Open the referenced file (e.g., `@article.md`). Keep all Markdown structure and formatting:

- Headings, lists, tables, links, code blocks, and blockquotes stay in place.
- Do not change the outline or reorder sections unless the user asks.

### 3. Deslopify the copy

Rewrite sentence-by-sentence and paragraph-by-paragraph, keeping meaning and intent but removing AI tells:

- Cut throat-clearing openers, dramatic pivots, and filler.
- Avoid formulaic contrasts (e.g., "Not X. But Y.") and cadence-heavy punchlines.
- Vary sentence lengths; do not default to rhythmic triads.
- Prefer direct statements over rhetorical questions and self-answering.
- Keep tone consistent with the source; do not inject a new voice.

### 4. Validate against the Wikipedia tells

Scan the output against the latest `references/ai_tells.wikitext` list and remove any matching patterns or stylistic cues. If a tell appears unavoidable, rewrite again until the tell is gone.

### 5. Deliver clean output

Return the revised content only. Do not include a score or commentary unless the user requests it.

## Guidance

- Preserve facts and claims; only adjust phrasing and rhythm.
- Keep lists concise; two items often beat three.
- Avoid meta phrases like "let that sink in" or "here's the thing."
- End paragraphs in varied ways; avoid the final punchline cadence.

**Evaluating options to extract agent skills specification**

I'm exploring ways to get the full agent skills spec text since the compiledSource JS is lengthy and tricky to parse. I'm thinking about fetching raw files from the GitHub repo for easier scraping or grabbing JSON data from the website. I'll also try scripting to extract all compiledSource instances to find the complete content for the specification. This should help clarify agent-neutral guidelines and necessary adjustments.

Using skill-creator to update the skill for agent-neutral usage per Agent Skills guidelines.

Updated `skills/deslopify/SKILL.md` to remove tool-specific examples, use relative script paths, and gate the fetch step on local-script/network availability so it works across agents (Codex, Copilot, Claude, etc.).

Next steps:
1) If you want stricter agent-neutral wording or a different trigger description, tell me the phrasing you prefer.
2) I can also add a short “compatibility” note or validation step if you want it in the skill.

## deslopify

Deslopify is a Codex skill that rewrites AI-sounding prose into more human copy while preserving the original Markdown structure.

### Use cases
- Clean up AI-written articles or blog posts.
- Make LLM drafts sound less formulaic before publishing.
- Preserve headings, lists, and formatting while improving tone.

### Example

Input (`@article.md`):
```markdown
# Product Clarity

Here's the thing: building great products is hard. Let that sink in.
```

Output:
```markdown
# Product Clarity

Building great products is hard. Most teams feel it early.
```

### How it deslopifies
- Fetches the current Wikipedia "Signs of AI writing" list (with an offline fallback).
- Rewrites sentence-by-sentence to remove AI tells and formulaic patterns.
- Preserves meaning, structure, and formatting.

### Invoke the skill
- Prompt examples:
  - `deslopify @article.md`
  - `deslopify this draft and keep headings as-is`

### Update the AI tells list

Updated `README.md` to describe the skill as agent-neutral and compatible with any Agent Skills–aware tool, plus adjusted the examples to avoid Codex-specific cues.

You can review at `README.md`.

Next steps:
1) If you want a short “Compatibility” section or a link to `https://agentskills.io/home`, say the word and I’ll add it.
2) If you want me to mirror the same wording in `skills/deslopify/SKILL.md`, I can align the phrasing exactly.
