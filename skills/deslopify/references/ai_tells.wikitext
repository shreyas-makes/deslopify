This is a list of writing and formatting conventions typical of [[AI chatbot]]s such as [[ChatGPT]], with real examples taken from Wikipedia articles and drafts. It is a [[field guide]] to help detect [[WP:LLMDISCLOSE|undisclosed AI-generated content]] on Wikipedia. This list is {{em|descriptive}}, not {{em|prescriptive}}; it consists of observations, not rules. Advice about formatting or language to avoid in Wikipedia articles can be found in the [[WP:PAG|policies and guidelines]] and the [[WP:MOS|Manual of Style]], but does not belong on this page.

Not all text featuring these indicators is AI-generated, as the [[large language model]]s that power AI chatbots are trained on human writing, including the writing of Wikipedia editors. This is simply a catalog of common patterns observed over many thousands of instances of AI-generated text, ''specific to Wikipedia.'' While some of its advice may be broadly applicable, some signs may not apply in a non-Wikipedia context.

The patterns here are also only potential {{em|signs}} of a problem, not {{em|the problem itself}}. While many of these issues are immediately obvious and easy to fix{{--}}e.g., excessive boldface, broken markup, citation style quirks{{--}}they can point to less outwardly visible problems that carry [[WP:AIFAIL|much more serious policy risks]]. If LLM-generated text is polished enough (initially or subsequently), those surface defects might not be present, but deeper problems can be. Please do not merely treat these signs as the problems to be fixed; that could just make detection harder. The actual problems are those deeper concerns, so make sure to address them, either yourself or by flagging them, per the advice at {{slink|Wikipedia:Large language models#Handling suspected LLM-generated content}} and [[Wikipedia:WikiProject AI Cleanup/Guide]].

The [[Wikipedia:Speedy deletion|speedy deletion policy]] criterion [[WP:G15|G15]] (LLM-generated pages without human review) lists some signs of AI writing, but it is limited to the most objective and least contestable ones, according to consensus. It includes three signs also covered here: The first can be found in {{slink|#Communication intended for the user}} and the other two in {{slink|#Citations}}. The remaining signs covered here are not sufficient on their own for speedy deletion.

Do not solely rely on [[artificial intelligence content detection]] tools (such as [[GPTZero]]) to evaluate whether text is LLM-generated. While they perform better than random chance, these tools have non-trivial error rates.<ref name="Russell" /> Detectors can be brittle to factors such as text modifications (e.g. paraphrasing and spacing changes) and the use of generative models not seen during detector training.<ref>{{cite conference|last1=Dugan|first1=Liam|last2=Hwang|first2=Alyssa|last3=Trhlik|first3=Filip|last4=Zhu|first4=Andrew|last5=Ludan|first5=Josh Magnus|last6=Xu|first6=Hainiu|last7=Ippolito|first7=Daphne|last8=Callison-Burch|first8=Chris|title=RAID: A Shared Benchmark for Robust Evaluation of Machine-Generated Text Detectors|conference=Proceedings of the 62nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)|year=2024|pages=12463–12492|location=Bangkok, Thailand|publisher=Association for Computational Linguistics|arxiv=2405.07940|url=https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.674|access-date=2025-11-08|archive-date=2025-08-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250824132743/https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.674/|url-status=live}}</ref> By the same token, do not trust too much in your own interpretation.

LLMs (and [[artificial neural network]]s in general) use statistical algorithms to guess (infer) what should come next based on a large corpus of training material. It thus tends to [[regression to the mean|regress to the mean]]; that is, the result tends toward the most statistically likely result that applies to the widest variety of cases. It can simultaneously be a strength and a "tell" for detecting AI-generated content.

For example, LLMs are usually trained on data from the internet in which famous people are generally described with positive, important-sounding language. Consequently, the LLM tends to omit specific, unusual, nuanced facts (which are statistically rare) and replace them with more generic, positive descriptions (which are statistically common). Thus the highly specific "inventor of the first train-coupling device" might become "a revolutionary titan of industry." It is like shouting louder and louder that a portrait shows a uniquely important person, while the portrait itself is fading from a sharp photograph into a blurry, generic sketch. The subject becomes simultaneously less specific and more exaggerated.{{efn|This can be directly observed by examining images generated by [[text-to-image model]]s; they look acceptable at first glance, but specific details tend to be blurry and malformed. This is especially true for background objects and text.}}

This statistical regression to the mean, a smoothing over of specific facts into generic statements, that could equally apply to many topics, makes AI-generated content easier to detect.

===Undue emphasis on significance, legacy, and broader trends ===
{{tmbox|image=none|text=Words to watch: {{strong|''stands/serves as'', ''is a testament/reminder'', ''a vital/significant/crucial/pivotal/key role/moment'', ''underscores/highlights its importance/significance'', ''reflects broader'', ''symbolizing its ongoing/enduring/lasting'', ''contributing to the'', ''setting the stage for'', ''marking/shaping the'', ''represents/marks a shift'', ''key turning point'', ''evolving landscape'', ''focal point'', ''indelible mark'', ''deeply rooted'', &nbsp;...}}}}
LLM writing often [[Wp:puffery|puffs up]] the importance of the subject matter by adding statements about how arbitrary aspects of the topic represent or contribute to a broader topic.<ref name="chronicle"/> There is a distinct and easily identifiable repertoire of ways that it writes these statements.<ref name="Juzek" /> 

{{blockquote|
The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was officially established in 1989, <mark>marking a pivotal moment</mark> in the evolution of regional statistics in Spain. [...]

The founding of Idescat <mark>represented a significant shift</mark> toward regional statistical independence, enabling [[Catalonia]] to develop a statistical system tailored to its unique socio-economic context. This initiative <mark>was part of a broader movement</mark> across Spain to decentralize administrative functions and enhance regional governance.

{{blockquote|Kumba has long been <mark>an important center</mark> for trade and agriculture. [...] The establishment of road networks connecting Kumba to other parts of the Southwest Region, such as Mamfe and Buea, helped <mark>solidify its role as a regional hub</mark>.
|From [[Special:Diff/1248482444|this revision]] to [[Kumba, Cameroon]]}}

LLMs may include these statements for even the most mundane of subjects like etymology or population data. Sometimes, they add hedging preambles acknowledging that the subject is relatively unimportant or low-profile, before talking about its importance anyway.

'''Examples'''

{{blockquote|text=During the [[Spanish Colonial Period (Philippines)|Spanish colonial period]], the name ''Bakunutan'' was hispanized to ''Bacnotan'', a modification reflected in official documents preserved in the [[National Archives of the Philippines|National Archives]] in Manila. <mark>This etymology highlights the enduring legacy</mark> of the community's resistance and <mark>the transformative power</mark> of unity in shaping its identity.|title=From [[Special:Diff/1265870147|this revision]] to [[Bacnotan]]}}

{{blockquote|text=<mark>Though it saw only limited application</mark>, it <mark>contributes to the broader history</mark> of early aviation engineering and <mark>reflects the influence of French rotary designs</mark> on German manufacturers.|title=From [[Draft:Goebel Goe II]]}}

When talking about biology (e.g., when asked to discuss an animal or plant species), LLMs tend to over-emphasize connections to the broader ecosystem or environment, even when those connections are tenuous or generic. LLMs also tend to belabor the species' conservation status and research and preservation efforts, even if the status is unknown and no serious efforts exist.

'''Examples'''

{{blockquote|text=It <mark>plays a role in the ecosystem</mark> and <mark>contributes to Hawaii's rich cultural heritage</mark>. [...] <mark>Preserving this endemic species is vital</mark> not only for ecological diversity but also for sustaining the cultural traditions connected to Hawaii’s native flora.|title=From [[Special:Diff/1262033910|this revision]] to [[Nototrichium divaricatum]]}}

{{blockquote|text=Currently, <mark>there is no specific conservation assessment</mark> for ''Lethrinops lethrinus'' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, the general health of the Lake Malawi ecosystem is <mark>crucial for the survival of this and other endemic species</mark>. Factors such as overfishing, pollution, and habitat destruction could potentially impact their populations.
|title=From [[Special:Diff/1235454313|this revision]] to [[Lethrinops lethrinus]]}}

===Undue emphasis on notability, attribution, and media coverage===
{{tmbox|image=none|text=Words to watch: {{strong|''independent coverage'', ''local/regional/national/[country name] media outlets'', ''music/business/tech outlets'', ''written by a leading expert'', ''active social media presence''}}}}
Similarly, LLMs act as if the best way to prove that a subject is notable is to hit readers over the head with claims of notability, often by listing sources that a subject has been covered in. They may or may not provide additional context as to what those sources have actually said about the subject, and often inaccurately attribute their own [[#Superficial analyses|superficial analyses]] to the source. This is more common in text from newer AI tools (2025 or later).

Human-written press releases have of course also cited news clippings for decades, but LLMs specifically asked to write a Wikipedia article often echo the exact wording of [[WP:N|Wikipedia's guidelines]], such as "independent coverage."

'''Examples'''
{{blockquote|
She spoke about AI on CNN, and was <mark>featured in</mark> Vogue, Wired, Toronto Star, and <mark>other media</mark>.
[...]
Her insights have also been <mark>featured in</mark> *Wired*, *Refinery29*, and <mark>other prominent media outlets</mark>.
|From [[Special:Diff/1276225083|this revision]] to [[Sinead Bovell]] (also note the [[#Use_of_Markdown|use]] of [[Markdown]])}}

{{blockquote|Her views have been <mark>cited in</mark> ''The New York Times'', ''BBC'', ''Financial Times'', and ''The Hindu''.|From [[Special:Diff/1285114966|this revision]] to [[Shamika Ravi]]}}

{{blockquote|Its significance is <mark>documented in archived school event programs and regional press coverage</mark>, including the *Mesabi Daily News*, which regularly reviewed performances held there.|From [[Special:Diff/1294930957|this revision]] to [[Virginia High School (Minnesota)]] (also note the [[#Use_of_Markdown|use]] of [[Markdown]])}}

On Wikipedia specifically, LLMs often painstakingly emphasize their sources in the body text—even for trivial coverage, uncontroversial facts, or other situations where a human Wikipedia editor would be more likely to either provide an inline citation or no source at all.

'''Examples'''
{{blockquote|text=The restaurant <mark>has also been mentioned in [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] coverage relating to</mark> incidents in the surrounding precinct, underscoring its role as a well-known late-night venue in the city [of [[Adelaide]]].|title= Trivial coverage with attribution, from  [[Special:Permalink/1305163154|this revision]] of [[The Original Pancake Kitchen]]; the reference added for this sentence did not exist.}}

{{blockquote|text=In the United States, university-based incubators and accelerators have expanded alongside these centers; <mark>an official Library of Congress review found that</mark> 31.5% of SBA {{bracket|[[Small Business Administration]]}} Growth Accelerator Fund Competition winners from 2014–2016 were university-based programs.|title=Attribution of uncontroversial information, from [[Special:Permalink/1317019290|this revision]] of [[Entrepreneurship education]]}}

In articles about people/entities who use social media, LLMs will often note that they "maintain an active social media presence" or something similar. This wording is particularly idiosyncratic to AI text and relatively uncommon on Wikipedia before ~2024.

{{blockquote|The mall <mark>maintains a strong digital presence</mark>, particularly on Instagram, where it actively shares the latest updates and events. Forum Kochi has consistently demonstrated excellence in digital promotions, with high-quality, engaging, and impactful video content playing a key role in its outreach.|From [[Special:Diff/1297291381|this revision]] to [[Forum Mall Kochi]]}}

In some cases, LLMs will create entire sections to assert notability, with a breakdown of the sources that have covered the topic in a list format. This is in contrast to how most articles are written {{--}} summarizing the content that sources publish, then citing them as footnotes.

'''Examples'''
{{blockquote|{{fake section|Media coverage}}
* **IRNA** – <mark>Coverage</mark> of his inter-city marathon events.
* **ISNA** – <mark>Report</mark> on an 80 km provincial peace run.
* **IFRC** – <mark>Feature</mark> on his humanitarian campaigns.
* **Fars News** – <mark>Interview</mark> on his national running projects.
* **Varzesh3** – <mark>Report</mark> on a 17-day endurance run.

LLMs have serious problems keeping a neutral tone, especially when writing about something that could be considered "cultural heritage"{{em dash}}in which case they [[#Undue emphasis on symbolism, legacy, and importance|constantly remind the reader of its importance]]. This happens even when LLMs are prompted to use an encyclopedic tone; they may insert promotional language even while claiming to remove it.

In a similar way, LLM chatbots also add promotional/positive-sounding language to text about companies, business, and products, such that it sounds more like the transcript of a TV commercial.

AI chatbots tend to attribute opinions or claims to some vague authority—a practice called [[weasel wording]].

'''Examples'''

|From [[Special:Diff/1323819205|this revision]] to [[Kwararafa Confederacy]]}}

AI chatbots also commonly exaggerate the quantity of sources that corroborate these opinions. They may present views from one or two sources as widely held (often combined with the vague attributions above), mention the existence or opinion of multiple "reviewers" or "scholars" while only citing one person, or imply that lists of examples are non-exhaustive when the sources give no indication that other examples exist.

=== Outline-like conclusions about challenges and future prospects ===
{{tmbox|image=none|text=Words to watch: {{strong|''Despite its... faces several challenges...'', ''Despite these challenges'', ''Challenges and Legacy'', ''Future Outlook''&nbsp;...}}}}
Many LLM-generated Wikipedia articles include a "Challenges" section, which typically begins with a sentence like "Despite its [positive/promotional words], [article subject] faces challenges..." and ends with either a vaguely positive assessment of the article subject,<ref name="Russell"/> or speculation about how ongoing or potential initiatives could benefit the subject.

===Leads treating Wikipedia lists or broad article titles as proper nouns ===
In AI-generated articles about topics with a title that is not a [[proper name]], such as a [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lists|list]], the first sentence of the lead may introduce and/or define the article's title as if it were a standalone real-world entity. While the [[Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Lead_section#Format_of_the_first_sentence|MOS]] does allow such titles to be included at the beginning of the lead "in a natural way," these AI leads tend not to be so natural.

'''Examples'''

=== Vague see also sections ===
LLMs tend to fill ''see also'' sections with broad terms. For example, a see also section on a article about a startup may link to [[Financial technology]]. Such entries may link to non-existent articles or be unlinked altogether.

Many studies have demonstrated that LLMs overuse specific words. These words started appearing ''far'' more frequently in text after 2023 than they did in comparable text from before 2023, which is almost certain to be human-written as it predates widespread LLM use.<ref name="Juzek">{{cite conference |last1=Juzek |first1=Tom S. |last2=Ward |first2=Zina B. |title=Why Does ChatGPT "Delve" So Much?

One or two of these words appearing in an edit may be coincidental, but an edit (post-2022) introducing lots of them, lots of times, is one of the strongest tells for AI use.

The distribution of "AI vocabulary" is slightly different depending on which chatbot or LLM was used,<ref name="Reinhart" /> and has changed over time. For instance, the word ''delve'' was famously overused by ChatGPT in 2023 and early 2024, but became less frequent later in 2024, then dropped off sharply in 2025.<ref name="merrill">{{cite news |last1=Merrill |first1=Jeremy B. |last2=Chen |first2=Szu Yu |last3=Kumer |first3=Emma |title=What are the clues that ChatGPT wrote something?

Please keep context in mind. For example, while the word "underscore" is overused in (pre-GPT-5) AI text, it can also refer to a literal underline mark or to [[incidental music]].

===Avoidance of basic copulatives ("is"/"are" phrases)===
{{tmbox|image=none|text=Words to watch: {{strong|''serves as/stands as/marks/represents [a]'', ''boasts/features/offers [a]''}}}}

LLM-generated text often substitutes constructions like ''serves as a'' or ''mark the'' for their simpler counterparts that use [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]]s such as ''is'' or ''are''. One study documented an over 10% decrease in the usage of the words ''is'' and ''are'' in academic writing in 2023, with no major changes in their frequency before that.<ref name="geng2">{{cite web |last1=Geng |first1=Mingmeng |last2=Trotta |first2=Roberto |title=Is ChatGPT Transforming Academics' Writing Style? |url=https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08627 |access-date=8 January 2026}}</ref> Similarly, it prefers phrases with ''features'', ''offers'', and the like to their more neutral counterparts with ''has''. Sometimes these constructions are more elaborate, e.g., ''ventured into politics as a candidate'' versus ''was a candidate''. 

This is particularly visible in AI copyedits, which will often "improve" text in this way. The study above also demonstrated that when GPT-3.5 was prompted to "Revise the following sentence" in 10,000 abstracts, the words ''is'' and ''are'' appeared less often in the revised versions.<ref name="geng2" />

=== False ranges ===
{{shortcut|WP:FALSERANGE}}

When {{xt|from ... to ...}} constructions are not used figuratively, they are used to indicate the lower and upper bounds of a scale.  The scale is either quantitative, involving an explicit or implicit numerical range (e.g. {{xt|from 1990 to 2000}}, {{xt|from 15 to 20 ounces}}, {{xt|from winter to autumn}}), or qualitative, involving categorical bounds (e.g. "{{xt|from seed to tree}}", "{{xt|from mild to severe}}", "{{xt|from white belt to black belt}}"). The same constructions may be used to form a [[merism]]—a figure of speech that combines the two extremes as two contrasting parts of the whole to refer to the whole. This is a figurative meaning, but it has the same structure as the non-figurative usage, because it still requires an identifiable scale: {{xt|from head to toe}} (the length of a body denoting the whole body), {{xt|[[:wikt:from soup to nuts|from soup to nuts]]}} (clearly based on time), etc. This is {{em|not}} a false range.

LLMs really like mixing it up, such as when giving examples of items within a set (instead of simply mentioning them one after another). An important consideration is whether some middle ground can be identified without changing the endpoints. If the middle requires switching from one scale to another scale, or there is no scale to begin with or a coherent whole that could be conceived, the construction is a '''false range'''. LLMs often employ "figurative" (often simply: meaningless) "{{xt|from ... to ...}}" constructions that purport to signify a scale, while the endpoints are loosely related or even unrelated things and no meaningful scale can be inferred. LLMs do this because such meaningless language is used in persuasive writing to impress and woo, and LLMs are heavily influenced by examples of persuasive writing during their training.

===Overuse of boldface===
{{For|non-AI-specific guidance about this|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Boldface}}
{{shortcut|WP:AIBOLD}}
AI chatbots may display various phrases in [[boldface]] for emphasis in an excessive, mechanical manner. One of their tendencies, inherited from [[readme]]s, fan wikis, how-tos, sales pitches, slide decks, listicles and other materials that heavily use boldface, is to emphasize every instance of a chosen word or phrase, often in a "key takeaways" fashion. Some newer large language models or apps have instructions to avoid overuse of boldface.

==={{anchor|Lists}}Inline-header vertical lists===
{{shortcut|WP:AILIST}}
{{For|non-AI-specific guidance about this|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lists#Use prose where understood easily}}
AI chatbots output often includes vertical lists formatted in a specific way: an ordered or unordered list where the list marker (number, bullet, dash, etc.) is followed by an inline boldfaced header, separated with a colon from the remaining descriptive text.

Instead of [[H:LIST|proper wikitext]], a bullet point in an unordered list may appear as a bullet character (•), hyphen (-), en dash (–), [[Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Use_of_Markdown|hash]] (#), [[Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing#Emojis|emoji]], or similar character. Ordered lists (i.e. numbered lists) may use explicit numbers (such as {{code|1.}}) instead of standard wikitext. When [[WP:SCOPY|copied as bare text appearing on the screen]], some of the formatting information is lost, and line breaks may be lost as well.

===Overuse of em dashes===
{{For|non-AI-specific guidance about the use of dashes|Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Dashes}}
{{Shortcut|WP:AIDASH}}
While human editors and writers often use [[em dash]]es (—), LLM output uses them more often than nonprofessional human-written text of the same genre, and uses them in places where humans are more likely to use commas, parentheses, colons, or (misused) hyphens (-). LLMs especially tend to use em dashes in a formulaic, pat way, often mimicking "punched up" sales-like writing by over-emphasizing clauses or parallelisms.<ref name="merrill" /><ref name="Kriss"/>

This sign is most useful when taken in combination with other indicators, not by itself. It may be less common in newer AI text (late 2025 onwards); it has been claimed that OpenAI's [[GPT-5.1]] could use em dashes less often than its predecessors.

'''Examples'''

{{"|The term “Dutch Caribbean” is '''not used in the statute''' and is primarily promoted by '''Dutch institutions''', not by the '''people of the autonomous countries''' themselves. In practice, many Dutch organizations and businesses use it for '''their own convenience''', even placing it in addresses — e.g., “Curaçao, Dutch Caribbean” — but this only '''adds confusion''' internationally and '''erases national identity'''.

===Curly quotation marks and apostrophes===
{{For|non-AI-specific guidance about this|Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Quotation characters|Wikipedia:Manual of Style#Apostrophes}}
{{Shortcut|WP:AICURLY}}	

ChatGPT and [[DeepSeek]] typically use curly quotation marks (“...” or ‘...’) instead of straight quotation marks ("..." or '...'). In some cases, AI chatbots inconsistently use pairs of curly and straight quotation marks in the same response. They also tend to use the curly apostrophe (’), the same character as the curly [[right single quotation mark]], instead of the straight apostrophe ('), such as in [[Contraction (grammar)|contractions]] and [[English possessive|possessive forms]]. They may also do this inconsistently. 

Curly quotes alone do not prove LLM use. [[Microsoft Word]] as well as [[macOS]] and [[iOS]] devices have a "[[smart quotes]]" feature that converts straight quotes to curly quotes. Grammar correcting tools such as [[LanguageTool]] may also have such a feature. <!-- NB: LanguageTool is partially powered by neural networks. --> Curly quotation marks and apostrophes are common in professionally typeset works such as major newspapers. Citation tools like [https://citer.toolforge.org/ Citer] may repeat those that appear in the title of a web page: for example, 
<blockquote>{{cite web | last=McClelland | first=Mac | title=When ‘Not Guilty’ Is a Life Sentence | website=The New York Times | date=2017-09-27 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/magazine/when-not-guilty-is-a-life-sentence.html | access-date=2025-08-03}}</blockquote>
Note that Wikipedia allows users to [[WP:CUSTOM|customize]] the fonts used to display text.  Some fonts display matched curly apostrophes as straight, in which case the distinction is invisible to the user. Additionally, [[Gemini (language model)|Gemini]] and [[Claude (language model)|Claude]] models typically do not use curly quotes.

===Subject lines===
{{shortcut|WP:SUBJECTLINE}}
User messages and [[Wikipedia:Identifying LLM unblock requests|unblock requests]] generated by AI chatbots sometimes begin with text that is intended to be pasted into the ''Subject'' field on an email form.

Editors sometimes paste text from an AI chatbot that was meant as correspondence, prewriting or advice, rather than article content. This may appear in article text or within comments (<nowiki><-- --></nowiki>). Chatbots prompted to produce a Wikipedia article or comment may also explicitly state that the text is meant for Wikipedia, and may mention various [[WP:PG|policies and guidelines]] in the output—often explicitly specifying that they're {{em|Wikipedia}}'s conventions.

===Knowledge-cutoff disclaimers and speculation about gaps in sources===

A knowledge-cutoff disclaimer is a statement used by the AI chatbot to indicate that the information provided may be incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated.

If an LLM has a fixed [[knowledge cutoff]] (usually the model's last training update), it is unable to provide any information on events or developments past that time, and it often outputs a disclaimer to remind the user of this cutoff, which usually takes the form of a statement that says the information provided is accurate only up to a certain date.

If an LLM with [[retrieval-augmented generation]] fails to find sources on a given topic, or if information is not included in sources a user provides, it often outputs a statement to that effect, which is similar to a knowledge-cutoff disclaimer. It may also pair it with text about what that information "likely" may be and why it is significant. This information is entirely [[WP:OR|speculative]] (including the very claim that it's "not documented") and may be based on loosely related topics or completely fabricated.

===Phrasal templates and placeholder text===
AI chatbots may generate responses with fill-in-the-blank [[phrasal template]]s (as seen in the game ''[[Mad Libs]]'') for the LLM user to replace with words and phrases pertaining to their use case. However, some LLM users forget to fill in those blanks. Note that non-LLM-generated templates exist for drafts and new articles, such as [[Wikipedia:Artist biography article template/Preload]] and pages in [[:Category:Article creation templates]].

'''Examples'''
{{blockquote|

==Markup==

===Use of Markdown===
{{Shortcut|WP:MARKDOWN}}
A lot of AI chatbots are not proficient in [[H:WT|wikitext]], the [[markup language]] used to instruct Wikipedia's [[MediaWiki]] software how to format an article. As wikitext is a niche markup language, found mostly on wikis running on MediaWiki and other MediaWiki-based platforms like [[Miraheze]], LLMs tend to lack wikitext-formatted training data. While the corpora of chatbots did ingest millions of Wikipedia articles, these articles would not have been processed as text files containing wikitext syntax. 

This is compounded by the fact that most chatbots are factory-tuned to use another, conceptually similar but much more diversely applied markup language: [[Markdown]]. Their system-level instructions often direct them to format outputs using Markdown, and the chatbot apps render its syntax as formatted text on a user's screen. For example, the system prompt for Claude Sonnet 3.5 (November 2024) includes:<ref name="sonnetprompt">{{cite web |title=System Prompts |url=https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/release-notes/system-prompts#claude-sonnet-3-5 |website=Claude Docs |publisher=Anthropic |access-date=9 January 2026}}</ref>

{{blockquote|Claude uses Markdown formatting. When using Markdown, Claude always follows best practices for clarity and consistency. It always uses a single space after hash symbols for headers (e.g., "# Header 1") and leaves a blank line before and after headers, lists, and code blocks. For emphasis, Claude uses asterisks or underscores consistently (e.g., italic or bold). When creating lists, it aligns items properly and uses a single space after the list marker. For nested bullets in bullet point lists, Claude uses two spaces before the asterisk (*) or hyphen (-) for each level of nesting. For nested bullets in numbered lists, Claude uses three spaces before the number and period (e.g., "1.") for each level of nesting.}}

As the above indicates, Markdown syntax is completely different from wikitext. Markdown uses asterisks (*) or underscores (_) instead of single-quotes (') for bold and italic formatting, hash symbols (#) instead of equals signs (=) for section headings, parentheses (()) instead of square brackets (<nowiki>[]</nowiki>) around URLs, and three symbols (---, ***, or ___) instead of four hyphens (<nowiki>----</nowiki>) for thematic breaks.

When told to "generate an article", chatbots often default to using Markdown for the generated output. This formatting is preserved in clipboard text by the copy functions on some chatbot platforms. If instructed to generate content for Wikipedia, the chatbot might "realize" the need to generate Wikipedia-compatible code, and might include a message like {{tqi|Would you like me to ... turn this into actual Wikipedia markup format (`wikitext`)?}}{{efn|[[Special:PermanentLink/1300700102|Example]] (deleted, administrators only)}} in its output. If the chatbot is told to proceed, the resulting syntax is often rudimentary, syntactically incorrect, or both. The chatbot might put its attempted-wikitext content in a Markdown-style [https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks fenced code block] (its syntax for [[WP:PRE]]) surrounded by Markdown-based syntax and content, which may also be preserved by platform-specific copy-to-clipboard functions, leading to a telling footprint of both markup languages' syntax. This might include the appearance of three backticks in the text, such as: <code>```wikitext</code>.{{efn|[[Special:PermanentLink/1297827841|Example]] of {{code|```wikitext}} on a draft.|}}

The presence of faulty wikitext syntax mixed with Markdown syntax is a strong indicator that content is LLM-generated, especially if in the form of a fenced Markdown code block. However, Markdown {{em|alone}} is not such a strong indicator. Software developers, researchers, technical writers, and experienced internet users frequently use Markdown in tools like [[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]] and [[GitHub Flavored Markdown|GitHub]], and on platforms like [https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043033952-Formatting-Guide Reddit], [https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline Discord], and [https://slack.com/help/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages Slack]. Some writing tools and apps, such as [[iOS Notes]], [[Google Docs]], and [[Windows Notepad]], support Markdown editing or exporting. The increasing ubiquity of Markdown may also lead new editors to expect or assume Wikipedia to support Markdown by default.

ChatGPT may include {{code|citeturn0search0}} (surrounded by Unicode points in the [[Private Use Area]]) at the ends of sentences, with the number after "search" increasing as the text progresses. There also exists an alternate shorter form with only the increasing number surrounded by PUA Unicode like <code>0</code>. These are places where the chatbot links to an external site, but a human pasting the conversation into Wikipedia has that link converted into placeholder code. This was first observed in February 2025.

A set of images in a response may also render as {{code|iturn0image0turn0image1turn0image4turn0image5}}. Rarely, other markup of a similar style, such as {{code|citeturn0news0}} ([[Special:PermaLink/1276934509|example]]), {{code|citeturn1file0}} ([[Special:PermaLink/1286349902|example]]), or <code>cite''generated-reference-identifier''</code> ([[Special:PermaLink/1276907078|example]]), may appear.

ChatGPT may add [[JSON]]-formatted code at the end of sentences in the form of <code>({"attribution":{"attributableIndex":"X-Y"}})</code>, with X and Y being increasing numeric indices.

=== Non-existent or out-of-place categories ===
{{shortcut|WP:AIREDCAT}}
LLMs may hallucinate non-existent categories, sometimes for generic concepts that ''seem like'' plausible category titles (or [[search engine optimization|SEO]] keywords), and sometimes because their training set includes obsolete and renamed categories. These will appear as [[WP:REDNOT|red links]]. You may also find category redirects, such as the longtime spammer favorite [[:Category:Entrepreneurs]]. Sometimes, broken categories may be deleted by reviewers, so if you suspect a page may be LLM-generated, it may be worth checking earlier revisions.

Of course, none of this section should be treated as a hard-and-fast rule. New users are unlikely to know about Wikipedia's style guidelines for these sections, and returning editors may be used to old categories that have since been deleted.

'''Examples'''
{{blockquote|<syntaxhighlight lang="wikitext">[[Category:American hip hop musicians]]</syntaxhighlight>|title=From [[Special:PermanentLink/1304282215|this revision]] to [[Draft:Paytra]]}}
rather than 
{{blockquote|<syntaxhighlight lang="wikitext">[[Category:American hip-hop musicians]]</syntaxhighlight>}}

=== Non-existent templates ===
LLMs often hallucinate non-existent templates (especially plausible-sounding types of [[WP:infoboxes|infoboxes]]) and template parameters. These will also appear as red links, and non-existent template parameters in existing templates have no effect. LLMs may also use templates that were deleted after their knowledge cutoff date.

'''Examples'''
{{blockquote|
<syntaxhighlight lang="wikitext">
{{Infobox ancient population

== Citations ==
{{For|non-AI-specific guidance about this|Wikipedia:Fictitious references}}
{{Shortcut|WP:AIFICTREF}}

=== Broken external links ===
If a new article or draft has multiple citations with external links, and several of them are broken (e.g., returning [[404 error]]s), this is a strong sign of an AI-generated page, particularly if the dead links are not found in website archiving sites like [[Internet Archive]] or [[Archive Today]]. Most links [[link rot|become broken over time]], but these factors make it unlikely that the link was ever real.

===Invalid DOI and ISBNs===
{{For|non-AI-specific guidance about DOI and ISBNs|Wikipedia:DOI|Wikipedia:ISBN}}
A [[checksum]] can be used to verify [[ISBN]]s. An invalid checksum is a very likely sign that an ISBN is incorrect, and citation templates display [[Help:CS1 errors#bad isbn|a warning]] if so. Similarly, [[Digital object identifier|DOI]]s are more resistant to link rot than regular hyperlinks. Unresolvable DOIs and invalid ISBNs can be indicators of [[Hallucination (AI)|hallucinated]] references.

===DOIs that lead to unrelated articles===
A LLM may generate references to non-existent scholarly articles with DOIs that appear valid but are, in reality, assigned to unrelated articles. Example passage generated by ChatGPT:

<blockquote>
Ohm’s Law applies to many materials and components that are "ohmic," meaning their resistance remains constant regardless of the applied voltage or current. However, it does not hold for non-linear devices like diodes or transistors [1][2].

1. M. E. Van Valkenburg, “The validity and limitations of Ohm’s law in non-linear circuits,” Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 62, no. 6, pp. 769–770, Jun. 1974. {{doi|10.1109/PROC.1974.9547}}

2. C. L. Fortescue, “Ohm’s Law in alternating current circuits,” Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 55, no. 11, pp. 1934–1936, Nov. 1967. {{doi|10.1109/PROC.1967.6033}}
</blockquote>

Both ''Proceedings of the IEEE'' citations are completely made up. The DOIs lead to different citations and have other problems as well. For instance, [[Charles LeGeyt Fortescue|C. L. Fortescue]] was dead for 30+ years at the purported time of writing, and [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31102&punumber=5 Vol 55, Issue 11] does not list any articles that match anything remotely close to the information given in reference 3.

===Book citations without page numbers or URLs===
LLMs often generate book citations that look reasonable but do not include page numbers. This passage, for example, was generated by ChatGPT:
<blockquote>
Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in the field of electrical engineering and physics that states the current passing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points, provided the temperature remains constant. Mathematically, it is expressed as V=IR, where V is the voltage, I is the current, and R is the resistance. The law was formulated by German physicist Georg Simon Ohm in 1827, and it serves as a cornerstone in the analysis and design of electrical circuits [1]. 

1. Dorf, R. C., & Svoboda, J. A. (2010). Introduction to Electric Circuits (8th ed.). Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons. {{ISBN|9780470521571}}.
</blockquote>

The book reference appears valid – a book on electric circuits would likely have information about Ohm's law – but without the page number, that citation is not useful for verifying the claims in the prose.

Some LLM-generated book citations do include page numbers, and the book really exists, but the cited pages do not verify the text. Signs to look out for: the book is on a somewhat general topic or commonly referenced in its field, and the citation does not include a link to Google Books or a PDF (not mandatory for book citations, but editors creating legitimate book citations often include some kind of URL when citing the book). Example:

<blockquote>
Analysts note that traditionalists often appeal to prudence, stability, and Edmund Burke’s notion of “prescription,” while reactionaries invoke moral urgency and cultural emergency, framing the present as a deviation from an idealized past. [1]

[1] Goldwater, Barry (1960). The Conscience of a Conservative. Victor Publishing. p. 12.
</blockquote>

=== Incorrect or unconventional use of references ===
{{Shortcut|WP:AICITESTYLE}}

AI tools may have been prompted to include references, and make an attempt to do so as Wikipedia expects, but fail with some key implementation details or stand out when compared with conventions.

'''Examples'''

In the below example, note the incorrect attempt at re-using references. The tool used here was not capable of searching for non-confabulated sources (as it was done the day before Bing Deep Search launched) but nonetheless found one real reference. The syntax for re-using the references was incorrect.

In this case, the ''Smith, R. J.'' source – being the "third source" the tool presumably generated the link 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3' (which has a PMID reference of 3) – is also completely irrelevant to the body of the article. The user did not check the reference before they converted it to a {{tl|cite journal}} reference, even though the links resolve.

The LLM in this case has diligently included the incorrect re-use syntax after every single full stop.

===utm_source{{=}}===

ChatGPT may add the [[UTM parameter]]s <code>utm_source=openai</code> or <code>utm_source=chatgpt.com</code> to URLs that it is using as sources. Other LLMs, such as Gemini or Claude, use UTM parameters less often.{{efn|See {{phab|T387903}}.}}

Note: While this does definitively prove ChatGPT's involvement, it doesn't prove, on its own, that ChatGPT also generated the writing. Some editors use AI tools to find citations for existing text; this will be apparent in the edit history.

* [[:Category:Pages with incorrect ref formatting]]

===Outdated ''access-date''s===

In some AI-assisted text, citations may include an ''access-date'' by default, but the date can look unexpectedly old relative to when the edit was made (for example, an article created in December 2025 containing multiple citations with <code>|access-date=12 December 2024</code>). This is not evidence by itself, but it can be a useful ''pattern to check'' when combined with other signs of low-quality drafting. Note that older ''access-date'' values can occur legitimately (copied citations, offline work, batch moves/merges).

== Miscellaneous ==
=== Sudden shift in writing style ===
A sudden shift in an editor's writing style, such as unexpectedly flawless grammar compared to their other communication, may indicate the use of AI tools. Combining formal and casual writing styles is not exclusive to AI, but may be considered a sign. Using more formal prose in some writing may simply be a matter of code switching.

{{anchor|Sudden shift in English variety use}}A mismatch of user location, national ties of the topic to a variety of English, and the variety of English used may indicate the use of AI tools. A human writer from India writing about an Indian university would probably not use American English; however, LLM outputs use American English by default, unless prompted otherwise.<ref name="Ju et al." /> Note that non-native English speakers tend to mix up English varieties, and such signs should raise suspicion only if there is a sudden and complete shift in an editor's English variety use.

=== Overwhelmingly verbose edit summaries ===
AI-generated [[Help:Edit summary|edit summaries]] are often unusually long, written as formal, first-person paragraphs without [[Wikipedia:Edit summary legend|abbreviations]], and/or conspicuously itemize Wikipedia's conventions. 

{{blockquote|Refined the language of the article for a neutral, encyclopedic tone consistent with Wikipedia's content guidelines.

=== "Submission statements" in AFC drafts ===
This one is specific to drafts submitted by [[WP:AFC|Articles for Creation]]. At least one LLM tends to insert "submission statements" supposedly intended for reviewers that supposedly explain why the subject is notable and why the draft meets Wikipedia guidelines. Of course, [[WP:BOOMERANG|all this actually does is]] let reviewers know that the draft is LLM-generated, and should be declined or speedied without a second thought.

{{blockquote|Reviewer note (for AfC): This draft is a neutral and well-sourced biography of Portuguese public manager Jorge Patrão. All references are from independent, reliable sources (Público, Diário de Notícias, Jornal de Negócios, RTP, O Interior, Agência Lusa) covering his public career and cultural activity. It meets WP:RS and WP:BLP standards and demonstrates clear notability per WP:NBIO through: – Presidency of Serra da Estrela Tourism Region (1998–2013); – Presidency of Parkurbis – Covilhã Science and Technology Park; – Founding role in Rede de Judiarias de Portugal (member of the Council of Europe’s European Routes of Jewish Heritage); – Authorship of the book "1677 – A Fábrica d’El-Rei"; – Founder/curator of the Beatriz de Luna Art Collection (Old Master focus).

Thank you for your review. -->|Found at the top of [[Special:Permalink/1317117951|Draft:Jorge Patrão]] (all the inevitable formatting errors are present in the original)}}

=== Pre-placed maintenance templates ===
Occasionally a new editor creates a draft that includes an [[WP:AFC|AFC]] review template already set to "declined". The template is also devoid of content with no reviewer reasoning given. The LLM apparently offers to add an AFC submission template to the draft, and then provides something like {{tlx|AfC submission|d}}, in which the "d" parameter pre-declines the draft by substituting {{tl|AfC submission/declined}}. The draft's contribution history reveals that this template was inserted at some point by the draft's creator. Invariably the creator then asks on [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/Help desk]] or one of the other help pages why the draft was declined with no feedback. The presence of a content-free "submission declined" header is a '''strong''' indicator that the draft was LLM-generated.

LLMs have been known to create pages that already have maintenance templates that shouldn't plausibly be there, including maintence tags and incorrect [[WP:protection|protection]] templates.

== Signs of human writing ==

=== Age of text relative to ChatGPT launch ===
ChatGPT was launched to the public on November 30, 2022. Although OpenAI had similarly powerful LLMs before then, they were paid services and not easily accessible or known to lay people. ChatGPT experienced extreme growth immediately on launch.

It is very unlikely that any particular text added to Wikipedia '''prior to November 30, 2022''' was generated by an LLM. If an edit was made before this date, AI use can be safely ruled out for that revision. While some older text may display some of the AI signs given in this list, and even convincingly appear to have been AI-generated, the vastness of Wikipedia allows for these rare coincidences.
<!--
Some beta users of OpenAI, specifically before safety gates were enacted on raw OpenAI calls, were part of a program for startups that gave them early access with an appreciable amount of tokens to spend. These users would likely be more experimental and interact with publicly-editable content for [[public relations|reputation-cleansing]] or other purposes, so the date could be set back toward mid-2021 as a [[ballpark estimate]]. -->

=== Ability to explain one's own editorial choices ===
Editors should be able to explain why they made an edit or mistake. For example, if an editor inserts a URL that appears fabricated, you can ask how the mix-up occurred instead of jumping to conclusions. If they can supply the correct link and explain it as a human error (perhaps a typo), or share the relevant passage from the real source, that points to an ordinary human error.

== Ineffective indicators ==
False accusations of AI use can [[Wikipedia:BITE|drive away new editors]] and foster an atmosphere of suspicion. Before claiming AI was used, consider if [[Dunning–Kruger effect]] and [[confirmation bias]] is clouding your judgement. Here are several somewhat commonly used indicators that are ineffective in LLM detection{{em dash}}and may even indicate the opposite.

* '''Perfect grammar''': While modern LLMs are known for their high grammatical proficiency, many editors are also skilled writers or come from professional writing backgrounds. (See also [[Wikipedia:Signs of AI writing#Sudden shift in English variety use|§ Sudden shift in English variety use]].) Some may alternatively interpret AI as using "bad grammar", yet the prose may merely adhere to different prescriptions or stylistic principles, such as whether singular indefinite "they" is acceptable.

* '''Combination of casual and formal registers, or language that sounds both "clinical" and "emotional"''': This may indicate the casual writing of a person in a technical field, such as computer science. It may also indicate youth, a preference for mixed registers, playfulness, or neurodivergence. Or it may simply be the result of multiple editors adding to a page.

* '''"Bland" or "robotic" prose''': By default, modern LLMs tend toward effusive and verbose prose, as detailed above; while this tendency is formulaic, it may not scan as "robotic" to those unfamiliar with AI writing.<ref name="jalt">{{cite journal |last1=Murray |first1=Nathan |last2=Tersigni |first2=Elisa |title=Can instructors detect AI-generated papers? Postsecondary writing instructor knowledge and perceptions of AI |journal=Journal of Applied Learning & Teaching |volume=7 |issue=2 |date=21 July 2024 |issn=2591-801X |doi=10.37074/jalt.2024.7.2.12 |url=https://journals.sfu.ca/jalt/index.php/jalt/article/view/1895 |access-date=21 November 2025}}</ref>

* '''"Fancy," "academic," or unusual words''': While LLMs disproportionately favor certain words and phrases, many of which are long and have difficult [[readability]] scores, the correlation does not extend to ''all'' "fancy," academic, or "advanced"-sounding prose.<ref name="Russell /> Low-frequency and "unusual" words are also less likely to show up in AI-generated writing as they are statistically less common, unless they are proper nouns directly related to the topic.

{{shortcut|WP:AILETTER}}
* '''Letter-like writing (in isolation)''': Although many talk page messages written with [[salutation]]s, [[valediction]]s, [[WP:SUBJECTLINE|subject line]]s, and other formalities after 2023 tend to appear AI-generated, letters and emails have conventionally been written in such ways ''long'' before modern LLMs existed. Human editors (particularly newer editors) may format their talk page comments similarly for various reasons, such as being more accustomed to formal communication, posting as part of a school assignment that requires such a tone, or simply mistaking the talk page for email. AI-generated talk page messages tend to have other tells, such as [[#Inline-header vertical lists|vertical lists]]{{efn|[[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sarwan Kumar Bheel|Example]] of a vertical list in a deletion discussion}}, [[#Phrasal templates and placeholder text|placeholder]]s, or [[#Abrupt cut offs|abrupt cutoffs]].

* '''Conjunctions (in isolation)''': While LLMs tend to overuse [[Transition (linguistics)|connecting words]] and phrases in a stilted, formulaic way that implies inappropriate [[WP:SYNTH|synthesis]] of facts, such uses are typical of essay-like writing by humans and are not strong indicators by themselves. While many people are taught beginning a sentence with a coordinating conjunction is nonstandard (or at least bad style), such usage has precedence and is accepted by many style guides. 

* '''Bizarre [[Help:Wikitext|wikitext]]''': While LLMs may hallucinate templates or generate wikitext code with invalid syntax for reasons explained in {{slink||Use of Markdown}}, they are not likely to generate content with certain random-seeming, "inexplicable" errors and artifacts (excluding the ones listed on this page in {{slink||Markup}}). Bizarrely placed [[HTML tags]] like <nowiki><span> are more indicative of poorly programmed browser extensions or a known bug with Wikipedia's content translation tool (</nowiki>{{Phabricator|T113137}}). Misplaced syntax like {{Code|''Catch-22 i''s a satirical novel.}} (rendered as "''Catch-22 i''s a satirical novel.") are more indicative of mistakes in [[Wikipedia:VisualEditor|VisualEditor]], where such errors are harder to notice than in [[Wikipedia:Source editing|source editing]].

== Historical indicators ==
The following indicators were common in text generated by older AI models, but are much less frequent in newer models. They may still be useful for finding older undetected AI-generated edits. Dates are approximate.

===Didactic disclaimers (2022–2024) ===
{{For|non-AI-specific guidance about this|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch#Editorializing}}
{{tmbox|image=none|text=Words to watch: {{strong|''it's important/critical/crucial to note/remember/consider'', ''worth noting'', ''may vary''...}}}}
Older LLMs (~2023) often added disclaimers about topics being "important to remember." This frequently took the form of advice to an imagined reader regarding safety or controversial topics, or disambiguating topics that varied in different locales/jurisdictions. Several such disclaimers appear in OpenAI's GPT-4 system card as examples of "partial refusals".<ref name="openaicdn">{{cite web |title=GPT-4 System Card |url=https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4-system-card.pdf |website=OpenAI |access-date=16 December 2025}}</ref>

===Section summaries===
{{Shortcut|WP:CONCLUSION|WP:INCONCLUSION}}
{{tmbox|image=none|text=Words to watch: {{strong|''In summary'', ''In conclusion'', ''Overall''&nbsp;...}}}}
When generating longer outputs (such as when told to "write an article"), older LLMs often added sections titled "Conclusion" or similar, and often ended paragraphs or sections by summarizing and restating its core idea.<ref name="Ju et al.">{{cite conference |last1=Ju |first1=Da |last2=Blix |first2=Hagen |last3=Williams |first3=Adina |title=Domain Regeneration: How well do LLMs match syntactic properties of text domains? |conference=Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: ACL 2025 |pages=2367–2388 |publisher=[[Association for Computational Linguistics]] |location=Vienna, Austria |date=2025 |doi=10.18653/v1/2025.findings-acl.120 |arxiv=2505.07784 |url=https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.120 |access-date=October 4, 2025 |via=[[ACL Anthology]] |archive-date=August 15, 2025 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250815014117/https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.120/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Prompt refusal===
{{tmbox|image=none|text=Words to watch: {{strong|''as an AI language model'', ''as a large language model'', ''I cannot offer medical advice, but I can...'', ''I'm sorry''&nbsp;...}} }}
In the past, AI chatbots occasionally declined to answer prompts as written, usually with apologies and reminders that they are AI language models. Attempting to be helpful, chatbots often gave suggestions or answers to alternative, similar requests. Outright refusals have become increasingly rare.

'''Examples'''
{{blockquote|

|From [[Special:Diff/1221340799|this revision]] to [[Parmiter's Almshouse & Pension Charity]]}}
=== Abrupt cut offs ===
AI tools used to abruptly stop generating content if an excessive number of tokens had been used for a single response, and further responses required the user to select "continue generating", at least in the case of ChatGPT.

This method is not foolproof, as a malformed copy/paste from one's local computer can also cause this. It may also indicate a [[Project:Copyvio|copyright violation]] rather than the use of an LLM.
